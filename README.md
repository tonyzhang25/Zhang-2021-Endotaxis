**`simulation_and_figures.py`**: code for all model simulations and figures.

`sim_log/`: data and figure directory.

`binarymaze_utils/`: utils for creating [binary maze](https://github.com/markusmeister/Rosenberg-2021-Repository).

### How to run `simulation_and_figures.py`

The simplest way is to upload this repo to Colab, which has all the dependencies already installed. Alternatively, run this locally using Jupyter Notebooks. Follow instructions in the notebook.
