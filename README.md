### Contents
This repo contains all the code needed to reproduce the analysis in the preprint. 

`simulation_and_figures.ipynb`: code for all model simulations and figures.

`sim_logs/`: output directory for data and figures.

`binarymaze_utils/`: some utilities related to analysis of [binary mazes](https://github.com/markusmeister/Rosenberg-2021-Repository).

### How to run `simulation_and_figures.ipynb`

One way is to upload this repo to Colab, which has all the dependencies installed. Alternatively, run this locally using Jupyter Notebooks. To recreate the analysis from scratch, empty `sim_logs/` and run all the cells in sequence.
